# Obeanstalk

Obeanstalk is an Async client for the beanstalk work queue.

## Documentation - Coming "soon":

In all seriousness though `make doc` will create standard ocamldoc
documentation. There should be enough stuff in `examples/` and `lib_test/` to
get started. The module should be completely straightforward if you've ever
worked with beanstalk before. In the meantime, checkout `lib/beanstalk.mli`.

## Wishlist
* Lwt Support
* "debug mode" to log all interaction with a beanstalkd instance
